# Starship-Simulator

This is a 3d simulation of SpaceX Starship launch profile, which I am seriously obsessed with, built in Three.js.

This project visualises the launch, stage seperation, ship orbit, booster return, and catch by Mechazilla arms. 

And yeah, it turns into a game after stage seperation, where you can maneuver and control the booster for a catch.

Note: This project is still under progress and major features are still pending to be implemented.


## Features
- 3D Animation: Watch the Starship launch, separate, orbit, and return in a fully animated sequence.
- Control The Booster: After stage separation, take manual control to land the booster.
- Realisitic Physics (Work In Progress): Aim to simulate basic orbital mechanics and landing dynamics.
- Built with Three.js: Leverages WebGL for smooth, browser-based 3D rendering.

## Demo
Video demo coming soon as soon as the first basic version works!

## Installation

Clone the repo, and start a web server either with npx or python.

## Progress 

- [x] Basic launch and separation animation
- [ ] Booster return and catch sequence
- [x] Ship orbiting
- [ ] Gamify booster catch
- [ ] Realistic Physics
- [ ] Sound effects and beautification (maybe)


## Contributing

I'm just working on this for learning purposes and most importantly because I'm obsesses by Starship, yes!

# Starship-Simulator

This is a 3d simulation of SpaceX Starship launch profile, which I am seriously obsessed with, built in Three.js.

This project visualises the launch, stage seperation, ship orbit, booster return, and catch by Mechazilla arms. 

And yeah, it turns into a game after stage seperation, where you can maneuver and control the booster for a catch.

Note: This project is still under progress and major features are still pending to be implemented.
